A Razor Pages project into which I have scaffolded Identity;  primarily to take a look at the scaffolded code.
So, 
(1)	I'll have a go getting it to use the class library ClaLibCore21.  seems to be doing that
(2) Now get the Register/Login integrated into the layout.  seems to be doing that 

At the moment 
	(done)I'm doing some basics like getting the 'areas' startup and the config file to function
	(done)Switching to ApplicationUser from the details WebAppRzpCore21User class.
